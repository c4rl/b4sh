b4sh - Some personal bash scripts
================================================================================

To install, clone the repo to your home directory, then add this to your bash profile:

    export B4SH_PATH=~/b4sh
    source $B4SH_PATH/all.sh

To add your own recursive scripts, create them in the sh directory, then add
them to all.sh as demonstrated.
